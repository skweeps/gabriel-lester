    <div class=".abtcontainer3"><p class="text"> Gabrie Lester is native to Amsterdam, and has constructed numerous works across mediums. His works range from sculptures, videos, physical structures and performances. I was drawn to his work because they lack traditional explanations and instead opt for more abstract symbolisms. Lester describes his work as narrative, hoping to tell a story with each piece. Lesters pieces are all very specifically composed, with each color and texture having meaning behind it. Lester utilizes all components of sensory artwork across his pieces. While focusing heavily on visual stimulus, he also uses audio and movement to his advantage to create more immersive experiences.
