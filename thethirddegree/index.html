        <div class="thirdcontainer2"><img src="../images/middlegreen.jpeg" alt="infared villa"><p class="text">The work itself is a sculpted city skyline placed atop a conveyer belt on an elevated desk. The conveyor belt itself  is in constant rotation, transitioning from a forested park to an urban landscape. The sculpture itself however is only half the installation, as there  are three large lights projecting the sculpture's shadow onto the chosen backdrop. The display itself is the piece, with the shadows dancing and glimmering on the wall behind. He described this piece as a “skyline of a recurring dream”</p></div>
        <div class="thirdcontainer3"><img src="../images/green3.jpg" alt="where i long to be"><p class="text">Due to the shifting of the lights, the piece is destined to an infinite loop, changing ever so slightly each time to take on new forms. The merge of nature  and city was displayed in the streets of Amsterdam to remind passers-by of the everlasting infiniteness of modern city life.
