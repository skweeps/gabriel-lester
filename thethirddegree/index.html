    <div class="thirdcontainer1"><img src="../images/middlegreen.jpeg" alt="sinking desert"><p class="text">Lester collaborated on this structure with artist Monadnock, for the exhibition ‘We Never Sleep’ by curator Cristina Ricupero in Frankfurt, Germany. The work itself is a network of doorways and open windows placed inside a circle sandwiched between the walls of the warehouse. Hanging in the structure is a single image of a man shrouded in darkness staring into your soul. The concept creates the illusion of being trapped in a labyrinth, with the very present reality of achievable escape.

        <div class="thirdcontainer3"><img src="../images/green3.jpg" alt="where i long to be"><p class="text"> The room is filled with natural light and openness, yet when you are inside the installation the network of walls feels claustrophobic. These feelings are enhanced further by audio of haunting echoes prompting questions to the viewer that’re more in line with a police interrogation than an art exhibit. Lester sought to bring a non linear narrative that evokes emotions of cross examination. Viewers described the experience as stressful and similar to being in a hospital.
